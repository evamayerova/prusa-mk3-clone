# STL

## Quantity to print
Beginning of each filename denotes the quantity of that part you need to print.

for example

1x_power_supply_box.stl means you should print one.

Any parts not found in this github you can find on [prusa research github](https://github.com/prusa3d/Original-Prusa-i3/tree/MK2)

## Print settings

All models should be printed as oriented in the STL files

No supports are needed

30% infill, triangular or fast honeycomb for strength

PETG is preferred

ABS might have shrinkage issues on some parts
